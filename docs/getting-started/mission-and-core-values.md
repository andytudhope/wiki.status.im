# Mission & Core Values

**Join us in putting Ethereum on every mobile device on the planet.**

## Beliefs

It is our belief that messenger apps are on the path to becoming gateways to our economies and social lives, they have the highest retention rates on user acquisition and more time is spent in messenger apps than any others. Successful messaging apps lend themselves to mass adoption and, combined with a strong open source community, we believe Status can solve a real problem with the on-boarding of people onto the blockchain;â€Šour favourite being Ethereum.  

Blockchains, more specifically *public Blockchains*, have the potential to restructure the very fabric of our society. We believe Ethereum provides the clearest path forward towards an internet where users get to own their own data, and economies are built on open protocols. We imagine a future where decentralized applications make central intermediaries and centralised servers largely redundant. We can pave the way towards **conversational crypto-commerce**.  

## The Mission

Our mission is to facilitate the transition to a more open internet. Status strives to lower the barriers to interacting with Ethereum, and to provide an onramp to the Web 3.0 for the average smartphone user - whilst at the same time fostering an inclusive and diverse open source community.

We intend to employ a strategy that contains three core components: *Technology*, *Community* & *User Aquisition*.

### Technology

- Status is built using Clojure.js, React and Golang. It includes a geth node on your device that uses the Light Ethereum Subprotocol (LES) to validate and sync with the blockchain. It uses Whisper (shh) as its messaging client and aims to integrate Swarm for storage.

- We build systems where the goal is not to dominate and control, but to provide tools and applications that facilitate the better angels of our nature, rather than feeding the purely consumerist habits we have become so used to believing have no alternative.  

- We actively experiment with and deploy the latest technologies in the ongoing drive to provide a slick user experience while not compromising on the security or sovereignity of any user's data.

- We offer an intuitve entry point into decentralized, encrypted, peer-ro-peer networks that is maintained by a large and diverse group of open-source developers.

- We approach all contributions with an open mind and respect the opinions of our fellow developers. We aim to foster an environment conducive to easy, intuitive and consistent learning and one that fosters innovation at all levels.

- We aim to help as many people to learn and contribute to the community's effort and always aim to encourage those more new to the paradigm of massively concurrent peer-to-peer networks than we are.

### Community

working with dapp develoeprs

### User Aquisition

marketing campaigns for dapp developers, user aquisition for mass adoption

## Core Values

- Free (libre) and open source software.

- Reciprocity, open-mindedness, respect and encouragement.

- Our work is driven by a belief that Ethereum and public blockchains can yield great benefits to society, and access to DApps and Ethereum should be made available to anyone, anywhere.

- The systems we're creating must be open, permissionless, award fair access and democratise power.

- Communication should be clear and transparent to everyone in the community.
